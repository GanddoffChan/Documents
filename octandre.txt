Edgard Varese is an avant-garde composer of the early 20th century in America.
He is considered to be one of the music representative of Music in America of that era because he lived in america for the majority of his music career and composed Ameriques which is based on his impression of the American continent as a whole (very funny hair).

from bar 2 there are repeated G flats from the solo flute
the note is held subsequently
E flat clarinet joins in with held D, creating an interval of minor 9th.

This is similar to Ameriques.
