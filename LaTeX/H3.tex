Dear Sir\par
I request the withdrawal of H3 Music for my ward, Chan Lok Hin Gordon from class 5C37. Here are the reasons to support the request.\par
My ward has been identified to have dyslexia. The condition makes it difficult for him to read a lot of text. Since H3 Music is a research paper, he would have much troubles gathering and organising information on the research topic. I am worried that he would not able to cope with the demands of H3 Music as it would take up a lot of time. \par
Moreover, he is very keen on taking up H3 Maths. According to his teachers and his performance in his promotional examinations, H3 Mathematics should be manageable for him. However, if he also take H3 Music, the maximum number of subjects allowed by his academic units would have been exceeded.\par
Yours faithfully\par
\quad\par
Kevin Chan
