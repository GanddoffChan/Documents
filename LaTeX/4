\section{Assumptions and Details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item the string has a finite length \(\ell\)
    \item the string has a uniform linear density \(\rho\) 
    \item the string is supended at its two end points by two identical poles
    that are distance \(d<\ell\) apart horizontally and have the same vertical level,
    \item gravity is uniform
\end{itemize}

\section{Derivation}
To determine the equation of the string \(y(x)\), 
let the point (x,y) be a point on the string that is distance \(s\) 
along the cable from the lowest point of the string. 
Also, let the tangent of the string at \((x,y)\) have an angle of \(\theta\)
with respect to the horizontal.
Futher let the tension acting on \((x,y)\) be \(T\)
and the tension acting on the lowest point be \(T_x\).
By equilibrium, it can be deduced that,
\begin{equation}
    \sum F_x=0\implies T\cos\theta-T_x=0\implies T\cos\theta=T_x
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \sum F_y=0\implies T\sin\theta-s\rho=0\implies T\sin\theta=s\rho
\end{equation}
By dividing the the two equations,
\begin{equation}
    \tan\theta=\frac{s\rho}{T_x}
\end{equation}
Let \(\frac\rho{T_x}=a\). Since at \((x,y)\), \(\dv{y}{x}=\tan\theta\),
\begin{equation}
    \dv{y}{x}=as
\end{equation}
