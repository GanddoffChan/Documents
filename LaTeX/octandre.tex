Edgard Varese is an avant-garde composer of the early 20th century in America.
He is considered to be one of the music representatives of Music in America of that era because he lived in America for the majority of his music career.
He composed Ameriques which is based on his impression of the American continent as a whole.

From bar 2 there are repeated G flats from the solo flute.
The note is held after a few iterations. 
E flat clarinet joins in with held D, creating an interval of minor 9th.
This continues until bar 16. 
This motif of minor 9th between the flute and E flat clarinet is also repeated as fragments later in bar 20 and 25.
