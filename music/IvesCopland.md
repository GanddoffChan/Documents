Q (a)
The following questions refer to **Bars 43 -- 55** of the movement.

Q (i)
Comment on Ives' use of treatment of **harmony** in this passage. [4]

A (i)
Ives used an atonal approaches.
He used atonal harmony from beginning to section M, which afterwards the music landed on the key of D major.
In this atonal section, poly-tonality emerges when multiple line of different keys are played at once.
For example, in 0'55"--1'00", the flute is playing 'Turkey in the Straw' while the strings are accompanying in a non-functional fashion.

Q (ii)
This section the 'cold, bleak New England winter landscape'. Elaborate on how
this effect is achieved. [2]

A (ii)
[The](The) effect is achieved by the dissonant chords played by the strings in a slow and harsh fashion.
There are also unexpected melody played by the flute in high registers.
These effects might suggest the scenario of cold wind blowing.

Q (b)
Even in the tonal sections, his approach to harmony is non-conventional. There are many passages with sudden atonal chromatic contours.
