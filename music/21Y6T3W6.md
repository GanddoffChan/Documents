"My aim has always been the liberation of sound; to throw open the whole world of sound music." -- Edgard Varèse

In your opinion, how has Varèse liberated sound? Refer in you answer to **at least three** works, only **one** of which may be a Focus Work. [30]

Three works: Amériques, Ionisation, Equatorial

In the past, composer often have to comply with the musical conventions of
their times. These conventions came in the form of tonality, harmonic functions
as well as form and structure. Although they ensure that the music produced is
musical and acceptable for the people at the time, following such rules
restricted access to all of the theoretically possible musical languages one
can imagine.  Edgard Varèse is one of the first composers who realised the
disadvantage of following the rules and decided to liberate the sounds of music
in expense of breaking the rules. The way at which he had achieved such will be
explained with three of his works: Amériques, Ionisation and Equatorial in the
following

Amériques is the first work which Varèse wrote after he arrived in America.
He aimed to describe his first impression of Americas through the piece.
