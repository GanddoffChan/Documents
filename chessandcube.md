=What Chess Taught Me About Cubing ‚ôüÔ∏è=

Hey guys, this newsletter is quite different from the usual and a bit more rambly but let me know what you think. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email and I'll get back to you but otherwise, here we goooo üèéÔ∏è

Have you seen the Queen's Gambit?

It's like the only TV show I watched in the past few months and it was pretty solid üëå A bit later, the magical all-knowing YouTube algorithm started recommending clips from it and before I knew it, I started watching binge-watching lots of chess videos and kinda got addicted (played like 5 hours of it straight last Tuesday).  Anyhow, I just thought one day kinda randomly - "I wanna compete in a chess tournament". So I signed up for a tournament at the Melbourne Chess Club in around a week's time - my first one in 5 years (I also invited some old friends I hadn't seen since high school for an interesting reunion there üòÇ).

So I started practising a bunch on chess.com and I was noticing how unlike my approach back in primary school/high school (which was when I last played it) when I was just spamming quick games with friends somewhat mindlessly, I was making a lot more of a deliberate effort to analyse my mistakes in each game + I learned some somewhat edgy/aggressive openings cos thought it would be fun throwing off my opponents üëå (generally the Danish Gambit for white and Geschev/Smith-Morra Gambit for black).

Anyway after playing way too much chess - the tourney came around on Saturday and I rocked up like 45 minutes early (I have a tendency of coming pretty early to new events, maybe it's something drilled into me by my asian mum over the years idk) and proceeded to try to chat up with some people.

The first guy I met was also called Jack so I was like 'oh cool we have the same name' but he was like hardcore analysing this chess puzzle on the board across me and I was like awkwardly spending the next 5 minutes trying to figure out what was going on too while trying not to disturb his concentration (turned out he was the top ranked player in the whole tournament and even he was having trouble - so you can imagine how clueless I was). I then proceeded to silently walk off to a nearby couch and pretend to check my phone, waiting for my friends to come along cos I didn't know anyone there üòÇ

Eventually though, I found this random teenager, and asked him about how long he'd been at the chess club for before playing some bullet games with him (2 mins each side) and I think I gradually eased my way into the environment from there. I think I managed to flag him (make him run out of time so I won) but then proceeded to randomly blunder my queen against some other random kid the following game before promptly resigning üëå

This kind of reminded me of my first cubing competition (Melbourne Cube Day 2014). I'm pretty sure I had some kind of social anxiety since I didn't talk to anyone throughout the entire competition (except some random primary school kid that said hi to me) and I feel like I see a bunch of people at their first comp be like that (i.e. staying with their parents). But I think that even just asking someone if they want to race against you (or anything really to get the ball rolling) can very much help you ease into the environment and to not just just give you a more enjoyable experience overall but help you perform better in terms of competition results too.

Anyway, going back to the competition - it was a 7 round swiss tournament which to the best of my knowledge means that you play against stronger opponents if you win and weaker opponents if you lose. I remembered back in my primary/high school days, I would always win the first one for some reason but because the competition was pretty tough (my rating is probably ~1200, avg tourney rating was ~1500), I ended up losing the first 2 and being shuttled to the the very bottom of the standings to play at the very last table in a side room against a 10 year old girl for the 3rd round.

Not to sound like I'm bragging but I've admittedly gotten used to people knowing me and assuming I'm going to win something at cubing competitions so I found that to be quite a humbling experience. Even though I ended up promptly destroying her with my go-to strat against lower rated players (fried liver attack üëå) - I was surprised by how on edge I was and how I was still a few minutes behind on the clock (I have a tendency of doing this) despite having an overwhelming advantage (although I almost didn't realise she was threatening my queen this one time so maybe it paid off?). Like, it felt like I was more nervous then compared to the finals of the last cubing comp (even though I had nothing to lose...except my pride?).

I also noticed another young girl midway through that game two tables across crying after presumably losing against some older dude and well - I think that kind of stuff happens at cubing comps too but it made me think of how much more tense chess comps seemed to be. Like even if all the blindfolded events were to run at a cubing competition - they'd generally be spaced apart and add up to less than 2 hours total (for me anyway) but the chess tourney was like 4 hours of back to back intense concentration (could feel my mind feeling drained at the end) and you're like literally competing head to head with another person the whole time too.

Anyway, I managed to claw my way back up, gaining another win against one of my high school mates who I happened to get matched against (get rekt Marlon), before being put up against an older lady (I'm noticing quite a large age range of competitors like in cubing although cubing definitely seems heavier on the kids-teens range). I think both our kingsides were open around the midgame and we were both kinda attacking each other so it felt like it was reaching some climax. However, somewhere in the midst of that, I performed this random check because I didn't know what else to do before realising 'oh wait that forces a win in 2 moves' so I guess I got lucky there? üòÇ. Ended up losing the last one (even though I felt that I had a slight lead at the beginning) but given the strength of the overall competition, I'll take 3 wins and 4 losses üëç

Anyway, here are the three key takeaways from this competition that I think that I can apply to cubing:

1: Continually learn new things and push myself - I admittedly haven't learned much in the past 2 or so years since my strategy in 3BLD was the consolidate what I knew and to attend a tonne of competitions since I felt that nerves/luck played a disproportionately large role in acquiring world records once you reached a certain threshold (which did happen) but I think that even though I could probably continue doing the same (and there's the fact that I'm one of the only top blindsolvers actually able to compete right now) - I think that I've realised that I'm more so driven to actually improve my skills as a whole and to not just rely on luck (although I still think I'll need some)

2: Deliberate practice - Previously, I was mostly spamming solves (and competitions I guess) in the blindfolded event but I'm starting to learn/replace new algs once again, looking into cancelling more moves between algs, figuring out how I can improve my memo, etc. I think it's easier to just mindlessly spam solves or to spam 3 minute blitz games on chess.com but I think I feel more convicted now in how I'd rather go for some long term growth.

3: Being more open to challenges - kind of ties back into 2 in some sense for myself personally but I think that for a lot of you, maybe it's the idea of solving the Rubik's cube blindfolded, learning 3-style, solving x amount of cubes blindfolded, [insert not yet mentioned goal here], etc.. I remembered mentioning this on my last appearance on Rubik's Fast Friday (instagram livestream) but always remember that there was a time when you once thought that solving the Rubik's cube normally was impossible.

And that's about it! Once again, let me know your thoughts on this somewhat different newsletter, if you have any questions (or enquiries about 1 on 1 coaching) but otherwise...

Have a lit day üïØ
