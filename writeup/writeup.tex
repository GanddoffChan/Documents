\subsection{Write-up on {\bf Wonky Steps}}

\subsubsection{Compositional Approach}
The piece, {\bf Wonky Steps}, explores the use of rhythmic counterpoint to create a sense of instability in the music, in addition to metric displacements and poly-rhythms.

\subsubsection{Structure and Motive Development}
Overall, the work is structured in 4 parts as such:

\begin{center}
	\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	subsection&Bars&Main Musical Features\\
	\hline
	A&1-11&falling fifth motive and cyclic bass line\\
	\hline
	B&12-16&counterpoint between bass and piano; running notes in clarinet\\
	\hline
	C&17-26&piano rhythm with increasing intensity; reprise of opening motive\\
	\hline
	A\(^\prime\)&27-35&canon in all parts; derived from the retrograded opening motive\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The piece opens with a series of falling fifths in both the piano and the double bass. After that, the double bass plays a bass line based on the melody in the clarinet part. This rhythm of the clarinet melody is constantly imitated by the piano throughout bars 5 to 10. A bar of transition is used to change the rhythmic character at bar 12, to link to a new subsection. The upper melody in bar 12 played by the clarinet is first played by the piano at bar 11 to foreshadow the new rhythmic motif.\\

The main theme in the second subsection is taken by the double bass, in a poly-rhythmic fashion, against the piano part. The double bass plays the same phrase of repeating rhythm as the phrase played in unison at the first bar of the subsection. On the other hand, the piano is repeating another seven-beat rhythm that emphasises all the even quavers of a bar while right hand plays three quavers in unison with the double bass at the end of each bar. The three quavers at the end emphasises the interaction between the piano and double bass parts. The clarinet then plays an rising Hijaz scale from G4 all the way up to E6. It then plays a falling scale of the pattern: whole tone, whole tone, whole tone and semitone, from E6 all the way down to F\(\sharp\)3, landing on the third subsection.\\

The third subsection spans from bar 17 to bar 26. In this subsection, the double bass repeats yet another rhythm while outlining the chordal qualities of the bars. The main effect created in this subsection however comes from the piano part. The piano plays an ever increasingly intense rhythm as the music progresses. In particular, in the first bar of the subsection, the rhythm consists of two crochets and two dotted quavers. In the second bar, it changes to three triplets and two dotted quavers. This pattern continues until on the fourth bar, there are five quintuplets and two dotted quavers. The frequency of note heard increases, building up to the climax. As a result, a sense of increasing excitement is created as the space between each note decreases as the music progresses. In the subsequent part, the three instruments are playing in unison to an irregular rhythmic pattern to resolve to an F\(\sharp\) major chord. Every note other than the last three notes in this subsection are accented so that the rhythmic qualities of this motive can be projected clearly. The rhythm used here consists of 2 groups of 4 quadruplets and 2 groups of 4 regular quavers. It is also worthy to note that these groups are arranged with non-retro-gradable rhythm.\\

The forth and final subsection starts from bar 25 until the end of the work. Canon is used in this subsection. It consists of a series of rising fifth motif with the rhythm derived from retrograding the opening motif. The canon resolves to a quasi-major chord.

\subsubsection{Rhythmic Technique Explored}
Rhythmic counterpoint is explored throughout the work. For example, from bar 3 to bar 11 as the double bass plays a two-bar rhythmic cycle, it creates a rhythmic counterpoint between the bass line and the upper voices. A similar approach is used from bar 13 to 20, where the bass plays repeated poly-rhythmic motives while piano and clarinet playing other higher voices.\\

Other techniques are also implemented, such as a metric displacement in the piano's line from bar 5 to bar 8 where semiquavers rests are constantly being added each time as the line repeated, and a non-retro-gradable rhythm from bar 21 to 22.

\subsection{Write-up on {\bf Infree}}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

The title of \textbf{Infree} describes the state of not being able to be free.
In this case, it describes the notes and voices in the piece being somewhat
strangled to one another, failed to separate and hence not free.
It also refers to the effect of tone clusters being rigid and not
scattered. Certain dynamic changes and rhythms are used to emphasise
the quality of the clusters.

\subsubsection{Harmony}

In the introductory motif,
a E minor tonality is suggested by the flute and violin.
That somewhat stable tonality is immediately destroyed at bar 2
when the tone clusters are introduced.
The following bar are tone clusters made up of major seconds,
followed by a handover of melody to the piano at bar 3,
where the piano play increasingly dissonant chords that are
eventually made up of minor seconds.\\

The piano plays this dissonant passage in triplets from bar 3 to bar 5
until it descends to the massive clusters at the beginning of bar 6.
At bar 6, the motif is accompanied by the piano playing powerful bass clusters,
which have more of an percussive effect than harmonic ones.\\

From bar 13 to 16, the piano plays chords that are made of 5 notes from
a whole tone scale. This chord raise 4 semitones from the first one
to the second one. The third chord is an octave lower than the first one,
and the forth chord is derived from raising the third chord 5 semitones.

\subsubsection{Motifs}


At bar 6, the woodwinds and strings play a modified version
of the opening motif, changed in a way that the motif
is made of clusters built in major seconds.
At bars 10 to 12, the piano plays a descending motif,
where all the chords are made of two notes that are a major seventh apart.
While the rest plays a three bar motif that is constructed by a minim,
followed by a quaver that is displaced a quavers backwards each bar.
The dynamics in these 3 bars resembles waves--whenever the piano plays forte,
the rest plays softly and vice versa.\\

In the following 4 bars, the piano support the triplet motif that the rest is
playing. That motif is made up of chord of minor seconds which oscillates up
and down for three sets of triplets and then goes downwards for the first two
bars, just descending triplets at the third bar, and descending triplets
that are grouped in twos at the forth.

\subsection{Write-up on {\bf Space Dust}}

\subsubsection{Compositional Approach}

The piece \textbf{Space Dust} utilises the twelve-tone technique approach. It
depicts the chaotic nature of space dust but also the birth of new stars though
the chaotic processes. This approach was revised and improved by Arnold
Schongberg in the early 20th century. The emphasis on all twelve tones in a
12-TET system being equal, with no superior pitch or a sense of home key makes
the music very atonal.

\subsubsection{Harmonic Structure and Motivic Development}

The piece has two major parts, characterised by their individual tone row
matrix. The first part is in \(\begin{array}{c}4\\4\end{array}\), bass clarinet and oboe play in parallel fifths,
followed by a piano solo. In the second part, the oboe and piano play dotted
quaver motif, with syncopation in between them. At the same time, the bass
clarinet plays crochets on the beats, emphasising the meter of
\(\begin{array}{c}6\\8\end{array}\).  The subsection in the first four bars ends
	with a resolution to an A flat major chord. A transitional motif in bar
	5 uses uniformed semiquavers. The motive in bar 5 is constructed with
	lines that are 3 semitones apart, resulting in 12 diminished 7 chords.
	The following bars are very dissonant to emphasise on the chaos.

\subsubsection{Musical Effects}

The effect of chaos is achieved through the use of polyrhythms. One prime example can be found from bar 21 to 23, where the oboe plays 12 evenly spaced notes per bar, the piano 4 and the bass clarinet 5. This creates a 12 against 5 against 4 polyrhythm which sounds chaotic. This highlights the chaotic reactions of space dust, full of discoordinated release of heat and light.
\\
\\
The effect of consonance is achieved at the later half of the composition, where all three instruments play the same tone row but at different amounts of delays. Since the tone row is mostly made of fifths, the delay actually makes many intervals of fifths between the different instruments, resulting in consonant sounding chords. This signifies resolution and the end of chaotic space dust reaction, meaning the birth of a new star.

\subsubsection{Technique Explored}

A tone row of D, G, E, A, B\(\flat\), E\(\flat\), C, F, A\(\flat\), D\(\flat\), F\(\sharp\) and B is used. This tone row is put into a twelve-tone matrix to generate a total of 48 other tone rows, which include the transposed, retrograde, inverted and retrograde-inverted versions of the original tone row. The tone row used is shown below:

\\
The three instruments, oboe, piano and bass clarinet are involved in this arrangement, with each of them playing different tone rows. Sometimes, the left hand and right hand of the piano play different tone rows. The notes they play can sometimes match and produce consonant sounding chords.
