Dreaming for piano

Melody

	The melody although simple, interest is generated by reharmonisation with the melodic notes are supported by changing harmony.
	At more harmonically complex parts, the rate of change of both the harmony and the frequency of changing melodic notes increases.
	Melody is mainly stepwise. However, at climax, the leaps of the melody are larger.
	The melody mostly diatonic but at climax there are some chromatic inflections.

Texture
	The texture is homophonic.
	There are instances of voice-crossings.
