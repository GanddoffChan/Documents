##Structure
1. Taksim: improvisatory passage by solo gambus or other melodic instrument in featured this free metered section
        Dance: salutation
3. main melodic section cq.sqqc (*kopak near the end of passage*)
        Dance: langkah
5. 3. Tahtim
        Dance: Wainab

##Taksim
- improvised
- often, if played on the gambus, the improvisation will feature fast running patterns, and fast alternating octave leaps

##Tahtim
- new melodic material appears
- kopak (loud intense drumming with interlocking patterns between the players) reappears

##Texture
Monophonic if played on the gambus
middle section will comprise melodies played slightly differently by the harmonium or accordion, and gambus creating an informal improvised heterophony
marwas and dok accompany these but chordal accompaniment is rare
kopak drumming appears for portions of the middle section and in the build up of tension in the wainab (coda)
