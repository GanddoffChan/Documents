1. She is implying the Aristotle's views on animals are __obsolete__.

2. She supports her claim by:
	1. describing how the rulers accumulated animals, often the most inspiring/fierce/unusual ones
	2. Describing how rulers ordered the catching of many animals to offer bloody extravaganzas
	3. to boost their reputation and demonstrate their superiority over their men and other sentient beings.

3. The process of approval is undermined because zoos:
	1. aggressively take animals away from their kin/ own kind/ species
	2. Devastation/ wrecking the communities
	3. Animals are __taken away__ from their __desired environment__
	4. and go through a __harrowing/stressful journey/ process of being moved__.
	5. Animals are __trapped in habitats that are alien to them and too close to humans__.

	1. [Much-vaunted]:
		1. The author is implying that zoos _widely publicising/ trumpeting_ their own actions in order to _praise themselves/bring attention to themselves_.
	2. [Self-justificatory]:
		1. and embark on these reintroduction programmes to _validate on their own existence_.

6. Initially, only _selected members_ had access to the Society/zoo. However, _economic needs_ forced/compelled the zoo to _open its doors to ordinary paying public_.

7. The author chose to express it this way as it is an _accessible_ indicator of size / _familiar_ sight / an image that we can all _relate_ to _envisage/imagine/visualise_ how big it is.

8. The Californian condors are a compelling instance of a success story as:
	1. their _numbers increased significantly_ from two dozen to 400 when bred in captivity.
	2. this was also achieved through _synergistic/combined_ efforts between zoos of exchanging finding.
	
9. As children are the _most enthusiastic and responsive/experience greatest joy_ amongst visitors to the zoo, the author ends with a focus on them with _a hope that such empathy will lead them to defend the interests and environments of animals_ later in their lives.

In paragraph 2, Walford posits that zoo subject animals to ill-treatment as a form of entertainment. This is largely inapplicable to my society. While it is true that in the Singapore Zoo, some animals are being made to be part of a daily performance routine as a form of entertainment, it is scarcely true that they are subjected to any form of harm in the process. In fact, the Singapore Zoo maintains very high standards on its treatment and handling of animals, making sure that they are well-taken care of - animals can choose to disengage during a performance if they wish to, performances are limited to 15 min duration and animals are trained to showcase their natural behaviours. In addition, animal shows at the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari do more than entertain, they also educate visitors on the threats that these animals face, for example, illegal wildlife poaching and trading of the pangolin for its meat and scales, and rally others to be involved in their conservation efforts. Besides, animals in Singapore are protected by strong animal rights regulations with Voluntary Welfare Organisations like Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) and non-governmental organisations like Animal concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES). These Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) work together with the Singapore Zoo to ensure that the welfare of animals is being safeguarded. The progress achieved by the Singapore Zoo today can be attributed to the efforts of these VWOs. In 2005, ACRES petitioned for the Singapore Zoo to half animals shows which made animals perform tricks, and in 2018, the Singapore Zoo scraped the Elephant show which made elephants pretend to fly and other tricks that were not part of their natural behaviour. At present, guests are invited to feed the elephants, have a closer interaction and experience their natural reactions. Hence, Wolf['s allegations are outdated as many zoos today, in particular Singapore's, have many measures in place to ensure animal welfare.
